# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Project Summary: EcoAware Community Awareness Platform
1. Project Idea
EcoAware is a community-driven platform designed to raise awareness about environmental issues, sustainable practices, and community initiatives. It allows users to access information, follow events, read blogs, and connect with resources that promote eco-friendly living.

2. Features
Core Features:
Home Page – Hero section, community stats, featured blogs, upcoming events.

Blog Section – Read community blogs, detailed blog pages, filter/search capability.

Events Section – Browse upcoming environmental events like clean-ups, tree planting, workshops.

Resources Section – Access guides, tips, and resources on recycling, clean energy, and sustainability.

Contact Page – Users can reach out to the team or community via a contact form and social links.

Responsive Design – Fully mobile-friendly UI built using Tailwind CSS.

Routing & Navigation – Smooth navigation between pages using React Router.

Optional Advanced Features (Future Weeks):

User login & community contributions.

Event registration or RSVP.

Interactive maps for event locations.

Filtering blogs and resources by categories.



3. Technology Stack

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS

Routing & Navigation: React Router

Data Handling: Mock data (JSON files for blogs, events, resources)

Styling: Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive UI

Future iterations could integrate backend APIs for storing blogs, events, and user data.


4. Development Plan (4 Weeks)
Week 1:


Set up React project with Tailwind CSS.


Create folder structure (components/, pages/, data/).


Add Navbar, Footer, and empty pages.


Configure React Router for navigation.


Week 2:


Build UI for all pages using Tailwind CSS.


Home Page: Hero, stats, featured blogs, upcoming events.


Blog, Blog Single, Events, Resources, Contact pages.


Integrate mock data to populate blogs, events, and resources.


Week 3:


Make components reusable (cards, buttons, forms).


Improve UI with dynamic rendering from mock data.


Add hover effects, transitions, and responsiveness improvements.


Week 4:


Optional: Connect to a backend API for real data storage.


Test, debug, and optimize UI/UX.


Deploy the project on Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.


Write documentation and project summary for submission.



5. Social Impact
EcoAware helps society by:


Educating Communities – Provides easy access to blogs, guides, and resources about environmental protection.


Encouraging Participation – Promotes events and campaigns that get communities actively involved in sustainability initiatives.


Fostering Awareness – Helps individuals understand the impact of their actions on the environment.


Connecting People – Acts as a central hub for eco-conscious individuals and organizations to share knowledge and participate in local initiatives.



6. Why This Project Matters


Tackles environmental awareness, a critical global challenge.


Bridges the gap between information and action by providing blogs, events, and resources in one platform.


Provides a hands-on frontend development experience with React, Tailwind, and structured project planning.



7. Deliverables
